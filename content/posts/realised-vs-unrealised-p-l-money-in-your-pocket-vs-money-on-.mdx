## 💰 Realised vs Unrealised P/L — Money in Your Pocket vs Money on Paper

Most investors check their portfolio and see **numbers changing** every day — but not all those gains (or losses) are *real*.  
Let’s clear that up.

---

## 🧠 The Simple Truth

- **Realised Profit/Loss** → You **sold** the investment. The gain or loss is **locked in**.  
- **Unrealised Profit/Loss** → You **still hold** the investment. The value changed, but it’s **only on paper**.

Think of it like a house:

> The *market value* of your house may rise — that’s unrealised profit.  
> You only *realise* it when you sell.

---

## 📊 Real-World Example

You bought **AAPL** at **£150**.  
Today it's **£170**.

| Status | Meaning | Value Change |
|:-------|:---------|:--------------|
| **Unrealised P/L** | Price moved, but you haven't sold. | +£20 (13.3%) |
| **Realised P/L** | You sold at £170 — gain is final. | +£20 (13.3%) |

If AAPL drops back to £150 *before you sell*, the unrealised gain disappears — you never actually made (or lost) money.

## 🧮 Try It Yourself — P/L Calculator

Paste this code snippet into your local repo (`/components/PLCalculator.tsx`)  


```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function PLCalculator() {
  const [buy, setBuy] = useState(150);
  const [sell, setSell] = useState(170);
  const [shares, setShares] = useState(10);

  const pl = (sell - buy) * shares;
  const percent = ((sell - buy) / buy) * 100;

  return (
    <div className="max-w-sm p-4 border rounded-xl bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">P/L Calculator</h3>
      <label>Buy Price (£)</label>
      <input value={buy} onChange={e=>setBuy(+e.target.value)} type="number" />
      <label>Sell Price / Current Price (£)</label>
      <input value={sell} onChange={e=>setSell(+e.target.value)} type="number" />
      <label>Shares Held</label>
      <input value={shares} onChange={e=>setShares(+e.target.value)} type="number" />
      <p className="mt-3">
        <strong>{pl >= 0 ? "Gain" : "Loss"}:</strong> £{pl.toFixed(2)} 
        (<strong>{percent.toFixed(2)}%</strong>)
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> 💡 *Tip:* Change the “Sell Price” to test different outcomes —
> what’s your profit if AAPL falls to £145?

## 📚 Why This Matters for You

* You only **pay taxes** on *realised* gains.
* **Unrealised losses** may recover — don’t panic-sell.
* Knowing the difference helps you plan exits, re-entry, and rebalancing.

## 📺 See It in Action

Inside **Pocket Portfolio → Trades → P/L View**,
you’ll find **unrealised** values.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Celebrating too early** — gains aren’t real until sold.
2. **Ignoring taxes** — realised profits can trigger capital-gains tax.
3. **Confusing volatility with loss** — prices move, but that’s not final.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* *Realised = sold = final profit or loss.*
* *Unrealised = still invested = paper profit or loss.*
* Pocket Portfolio shows **both** transparently so you always know what’s real.
