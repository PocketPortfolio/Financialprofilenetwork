## Abstract

This research report delves into the implications of container image sizes on deployment efficiency, performance, and resource utilization in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. As containerization becomes increasingly prevalent in deploying and managing AI models, the size of container images emerges as a critical factor influencing the speed of deployment, scalability, and operational costs. By analyzing a range of benchmarks and conducting empirical studies, we demonstrate the significant advantages of optimizing container image sizes, including reduced build times, enhanced performance, and lower resource consumption. The findings underscore the importance of adopting best practices for container image optimization, as highlighted in the video "Docker Image BEST Practices - From 1.2GB to 10MB" by Better Stack, to achieve efficient and cost-effective AI deployments.

## Methodology

The research was conducted through a combination of quantitative analysis and qualitative evaluation. Data sources included performance benchmarks of containerized AI applications with varying image sizes, as well as case studies from industry practices. The benchmarks focused on key metrics such as build time, startup time, and resource usage (CPU and memory). Additionally, the methodology involved reviewing existing literature and best practices related to container image optimization, including the insights provided in the referenced video.

## Key Findings

1. **Impact of Image Size on Performance**: Our benchmarks revealed a direct correlation between container image size and deployment performance. Larger images significantly increase build and startup times, while optimized, smaller images facilitate quicker deployment and scaling.

2. **Resource Utilization**: Smaller images demonstrated a marked decrease in CPU and memory usage, leading to more efficient resource utilization across deployment environments. This is particularly critical in AI applications where resource efficiency can directly influence model performance and scalability.

3. **Architectural Trade-offs**: The research identified key architectural considerations when optimizing container images. For instance, using multi-stage builds and selecting the appropriate base images can drastically reduce image size but may require additional configuration and maintenance efforts.

4. **Video Insights**: The video "Docker Image BEST Practices - From 1.2GB to 10MB" by Better Stack provided practical recommendations for image optimization, such as leveraging Alpine Linux as a minimal base and utilizing `.dockerignore` files to exclude unnecessary files. These practices were validated by our benchmarks.
