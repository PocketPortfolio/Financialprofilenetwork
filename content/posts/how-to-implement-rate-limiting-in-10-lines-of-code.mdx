Rate limiting is crucial for protecting your APIs from overuse and abuse, ensuring fair resource access across all users. Here's how you can implement a basic rate limiter in just 10 lines of Python code.

```pytho
n
import time

class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_calls, period):
        self.calls = []
        self.max_calls = max_calls
        self.period = period

    def attempt_call(self):
        now = time.time()
        self.calls = [call for call in self.calls if call > now - self.period]
        if len(self.calls) < self.max_calls:
            self.calls.append(now)
            return True
        return False
```

This simple `RateLimiter` class allows you to specify the maximum number of calls (`max_calls`) and the period (in seconds) over which these calls can be made (`period`). The `attempt_call` method checks if adding a new call would exceed the rate limit. If not, it records the call's timestamp and allows the action; otherwise, it denies the attempt.

### Key Concepts

- **Call Window**: We use a sliding window based on the current time and the specified period to check if a new call can be made.
- **Efficiency**: By pruning calls outside the current window each time `attempt_call` is invoked, we keep the `calls` list short and the method efficient.

### Quick Tip

Beware of time synchronization issues in distributed systems. If your application spans multiple servers, consider using a centralized time source or a distributed rate limiting solution to prevent inconsistencies.

Implementing rate limiting is a straightforward but essential task in protecting your application’s resources. This Python example offers a simple yet effective approach, ensuring your APIs remain reliable and accessible.
