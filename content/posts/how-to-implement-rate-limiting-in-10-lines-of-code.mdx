Efficient service delivery and resource management in web applications demand effective rate limiting strategies. Without them, your system is vulnerable to abuse and overload. Here’s how to implement a simple rate limiter in your app with just 10 lines of code.

```pytho
n
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from redis import Redis
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
redis = Redis()

@app.route('/my_endpoint')
def my_endpoint():
    key = "rate_limit:" + request.remote_addr
    try:
        if redis.incr(key) > 100:
            return jsonify({"error": "Too many requests"}), 429
    except Exception:
        redis.set(key, 1, ex=60)
    return jsonify({"success": "Request successful"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts

- **Redis**: A fast, in-memory data store used here for counting and tracking requests by IP address.
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to create the web endpoint.
- **Rate Limiting Logic**: The code increments a counter (stored in Redis) for each request from a unique IP address. If the number of requests exceeds 100 in a minute (60 seconds), subsequent requests from the same IP are blocked until the counter resets.

### Quick Tip

The rate limiting strategy shown above is based on a fixed window algorithm, which is simple to implement but might allow bursts of traffic at the window's edge. Consider using a sliding log algorithm for smoother rate limiting.

This code snippet provides a foundational logic for implementing rate limiting in applications. Adjust the request threshold and window size according to your specific requirements to ensure your application's scalability and resilience against traffic spikes and abusive behaviors.
