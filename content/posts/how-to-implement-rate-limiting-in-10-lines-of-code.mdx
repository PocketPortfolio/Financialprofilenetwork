Rate limiting is crucial for preventing abuse and ensuring equitable resource distribution in web applications. Here's how you can implement it succinctly in just 10 lines of code.

```pytho
n
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from redis import Redis
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
redis = Redis()

@app.route("/my_endpoint")
def my_endpoint():
    key = f"rate_limit:{request.remote_addr}:{int(time.time() / 60)}"
    attempts = redis.incr(key)
    redis.expire(key, 60)
    
    if attempts > 10:
        return jsonify({"error": "Too many requests"}), 429
    
    return jsonify({"message": "Request successful"})
```

**Explanation:**

- **Flask** is used for the web framework, and **Redis** acts as a fast, in-memory data store to track request counts.
- We construct a unique `key` for each IP address by appending the requester's IP (`request.remote_addr`) and the current minute (`int(time.time() / 60)`). This granularity allows us to limit requests per minute.
- `redis.incr(key)` increments the request count for the key, returning the new count.
- `redis.expire(key, 60)` ensures the key expires after 60 seconds, resetting the count for the next minute.
- If the `attempts` exceed a predefined threshold (10 in this example), we return an error response with a 429 status code, indicating too many requests.

**Quick Tip:** Adjust the request threshold and time window based on your application's specific needs and resource availability to prevent rate limiting from becoming too restrictive or too lenient.

This simple yet effective rate limiting mechanism can be adapted and extended to fit various application architectures, ensuring your resources are optimally used and protected against potential abuse.
