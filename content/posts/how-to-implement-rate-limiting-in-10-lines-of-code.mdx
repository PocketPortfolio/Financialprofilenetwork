Rate limiting is crucial for preventing abuse and ensuring the fair use of resources in web applications. Here's how to implement it in just 10 lines of code.

```pytho
n
import time

def rate_limiter(max_requests, period=60):
    timeline = []
    def request_handler():
        current_time = time.time()
        if len(timeline) < max_requests:
            timeline.append(current_time)
            return True
        if current_time - timeline[0] > period:
            timeline.pop(0)
            timeline.append(current_time)
            return True
        return False
    return request_handler
```

**Explanation:**

- `max_requests`: The maximum number of requests allowed.
- `period`: The time window in seconds during which the `max_requests` count applies.
- `timeline`: A list to keep track of the timestamps of the incoming requests.
- `request_handler()`: A closure that checks whether a new request is within rate limits. It returns `True` if the request is allowed, `False` otherwise.

This implementation uses a sliding window algorithm. It records each request's timestamp in a list (`timeline`). When a new request arrives, it checks:
1. If the list isn't full (`len(timeline) < max_requests`), the request is allowed.
2. If the oldest request in the list occurred more than `period` seconds ago, it's removed, making room for the new request.

**Quick Tip:**

This code is a basic implementation and works well for single-instance applications. For distributed systems, consider using a centralized store (like Redis) to maintain the state across instances.

Implementing rate limiting efficiently safeguards your application against overuse and potential abuse, ensuring availability and reliability for all users.
