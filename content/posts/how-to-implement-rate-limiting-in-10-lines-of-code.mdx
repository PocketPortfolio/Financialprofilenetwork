When building web applications, managing the rate at which users can make requests is crucial to prevent abuse and ensure service reliability. Rate limiting is the solution, but how can you implement it succinctly?

Here's a direct solution using Python and Flask—a popular web framework. This code snippet demonstrates a simple yet effective way to rate limit requests:

```pytho
n
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from functools import wraps
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
clients = {}

def rate_limiter(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        client_ip = request.remote_addr
        if client_ip not in clients:
            clients[client_ip] = time.time()
        elif time.time() - clients[client_ip] < 60:
            return jsonify({"error": "Too many requests"}), 429
        clients[client_ip] = time.time()
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function

@app.route('/data', methods=['GET'])
@rate_limiter
def get_data():
    return jsonify({"data": "Here's your data"})
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python that's easy to use for building web applications.
- **Decorators**: Functions that wrap around another function to modify its behavior. In this case, `@rate_limiter` is a decorator that adds rate limiting functionality to any route it's applied to.
- **Time Tracking**: The core of this rate limiting implementation is tracking the time of the last request from each client (identified by IP address) and denying requests that come in too quickly after the previous one.

### Quick Tip

When implementing rate limiting, consider the specific needs of your application. The example provided uses a 60-second limit, but you might need a tighter or looser restriction based on your use case. Also, remember that using the IP address to identify clients might not work well in environments where users share the same external IP (e.g., corporate networks or VPNs).

This code is a basic implementation meant for educational purposes. For production environments, you should consider more robust solutions like those provided by web servers (e.g., Nginx) or dedicated rate limiting services.
