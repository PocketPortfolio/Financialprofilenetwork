Implementing rate limiting is crucial for controlling the rate at which user requests are handled by your application, preventing overuse of resources and ensuring fair usage. Here’s how you can achieve this efficiently in 10 lines of code.

```pytho
n
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from redis import Redis
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
redis = Redis()

def rate_limiter():
    ip = request.remote_addr
    current_time = time.time()
    if redis.exists(ip) and int(redis.get(ip)) >= 10:
        return jsonify({"error": "Too many requests"}), 429
    redis.setex(ip, 60, int(redis.get(ip) or 0) + 1)
    return True

@app.route('/')
def index():
    if rate_limiter() != True:
        return rate_limiter()
    return jsonify({"message": "Request successful"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts

This code uses Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework, and Redis, an in-memory data structure store, to implement a simple rate limiting mechanism. The `rate_limiter` function checks if a request from a specific IP address has exceeded 10 requests per minute. If it has, the server returns a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code. Otherwise, it increments the request count for that IP in Redis, which automatically expires after 60 seconds, using the `SETEX` command.

### Quick Tip

Ensure Redis is properly installed and running on your system for this code to work. This example uses Redis' simplicity and speed, making it a powerful choice for tracking request counts in real-time.

Implementing rate limiting in your applications can safeguard your resources from abuse and help distribute them fairly among users. This simple, effective method provides a solid foundation that you can adapt and expand based on your specific needs.
