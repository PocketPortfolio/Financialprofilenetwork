Rate limiting is essential for controlling the amount of incoming requests to a server, ensuring that resources are evenly distributed and preventing abuse. Implementing this feature doesn't have to be complex. Here's how you can do it in just 10 lines of code.

```pytho
n
import time

def rate_limiter(max_requests, period):
    timeline = []
    
    def request_handler():
        current_time = time.time()
        if len(timeline) < max_requests:
            timeline.append(current_time)
            return True
        if current_time - timeline[0] > period:
            timeline.pop(0)
            timeline.append(current_time)
            return True
        return False
    return request_handler

# Example usage:
limiter = rate_limiter(3, 60)  # 3 requests per 60 seconds
```

**Explanation:**

- `rate_limiter` is a higher-order function that takes two parameters: `max_requests` (the maximum number of requests allowed) and `period` (the time frame in seconds for these requests).
- It initializes an empty list `timeline` to keep track of the timestamps of incoming requests.
- The `request_handler` function is defined within `rate_limiter`. It checks if the number of requests is below the limit or if the oldest request in the `timeline` is outside the current rate limit period.
- If the request can be processed, it updates the `timeline` with the current timestamp and returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`, signaling a rate limit hit.

**Quick Tip:**

For a distributed or high-load system, consider implementing this logic with a more scalable storage mechanism like Redis. This example is best suited for simple applications or as a learning tool.

**Gotcha:**

Be cautious of the server's clock drifts or adjustments, which may affect the timing accuracy in rate limiting. In distributed systems, always rely on synchronized time sources.
