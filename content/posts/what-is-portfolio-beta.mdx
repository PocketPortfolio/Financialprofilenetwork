If you own 5 different tech stocks, you might feel "diversified."
But if the market drops 10%, and your portfolio drops 20%, you have a high **Beta**.

## What is Beta?

Beta is a measure of volatility relative to the overall market (usually the S&P 500).

* **Beta = 1.0:** Your portfolio moves exactly with the market.
* **Beta > 1.0:** High Volatility. (e.g., Tesla, Nvidia). You take more risk for potentially higher reward.
* **Beta < 1.0:** Low Volatility. (e.g., Coca-Cola, Utilities). You are "defensive."

## Why does it matter?

If you are nearing retirement, or you need access to your cash soon, a Beta of **1.5** is dangerous. It means a standard market correction could wipe out a significant chunk of your wealth right when you need it.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you have £100,000 invested with a Beta of 1.5:
- Market drops 10% (common correction)
- Your portfolio drops 15% (1.5 × 10%)
- You lose £15,000 instead of £10,000

That extra £5,000 loss could be the difference between retiring on time or working another year.

## How to calculate it?

You can do the math manually by finding the weighted average of the beta for every stock you own.

**Manual Formula:**
```
Portfolio Beta = (Stock1_Beta × Weight1) + (Stock2_Beta × Weight2) + ...
```

## The "Sovereign" Approach

Apps like Robinhood encourage high-beta trading because they profit from volatility.
At **Pocket Portfolio**, we believe in knowing the truth about your money. Understanding your risk score is the first step to true financial sovereignty.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Beta measures volatility**, not returns. A high Beta doesn't mean higher returns—it means higher risk.
2. **Diversification isn't just about number of stocks**—it's about correlation. 10 tech stocks can still have a Beta of 1.5.
3. **Your Beta should match your timeline.** If you're 5 years from retirement, a Beta above 1.2 is risky.
4. **Calculate it regularly.** Your Beta changes as you add/remove positions.
