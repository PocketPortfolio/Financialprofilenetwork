## Abstract

This research report provides a comprehensive analysis of edge computing latency, with a focus on global distribution patterns. By dissecting latency from a multitude of edge nodes spread across various geographic locations, we endeavor to offer a nuanced understanding of the performance benefits and the architectural trade-offs associated with deploying edge computing solutions. Through extensive data collection, benchmarks, and quantitative analysis, this report highlights the critical role of geographical proximity, network infrastructure, and software optimizations in minimizing latency. Key findings reveal significant variations in latency based on regional network efficiency, the density of edge computing nodes, and the adoption of advanced network protocols. This report is intended for stakeholders evaluating the potential of edge computing to enhance application performance and user experience by leveraging the distributed nature of edge architectures.

## Methodology

Our research employed a multi-step approach to analyze edge computing latency comprehensively. Initially, we identified a diverse set of edge nodes operated by major cloud providers across different continents including North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. We used a combination of synthetic monitoring tools and real user measurement (RUM) data to gather latency metrics. Benchmarks focused on round-trip time (RTT), data throughput, and error rates under various network conditions. To ensure the accuracy and relevance of our findings, we compared our data against industry standards and protocols, such as those outlined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

## Key Findings

1. **Geographical Proximity Matters**: Latency significantly decreases as the physical distance between the end-user and the edge node reduces. Regions with a high density of edge nodes demonstrated better overall performance.
   
2. **Network Infrastructure**: Advanced network infrastructure, including the adoption of 5G and fiber-optic connections, plays a pivotal role in reducing latency. Countries with widespread access to these technologies showed markedly lower latency figures.
   
3. **Software Optimizations**: The implementation of software-level optimizations, such as connection pooling, data compression, and edge-native applications, can significantly mitigate latency, even in regions with less developed physical network infrastructures.

4. **Video Reference**: The included video "What is edge computing?" by TECHtalk provides a foundational understanding of edge computing principles, which is crucial for interpreting the nuances of our latency analysis.
