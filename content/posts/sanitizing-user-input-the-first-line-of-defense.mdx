Unfiltered user input can be a gateway for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in your system. Sanitizing this input is thus critical in fortifying your application's defenses.

### Direct Solution with Code

Suppose we're accepting a username from a user, which will be inserted into a database. Here's how to sanitize this input using Python with the `bleach` library:

```python
import bleach

# User input
raw_username = "<script>alert('Malicious Code');</script>username"

# Sanitize the input
sanitized_username = bleach.clean(raw_username)

# sanitized_username now equals "username", with the script tag removed
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts

Sanitizing involves cleaning or filtering user input to ensure it does not contain harmful or unnecessary data before it's processed by your application. This process helps prevent a wide range of attacks, including SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and others.

The `bleach` library in Python, as shown above, removes or escapes tags and attributes that are not explicitly allowed, effectively preventing the execution of harmful scripts.

### Quick Tip

Always whitelist allowed characters or patterns instead of trying to blacklist harmful ones. Attackers can be incredibly creative, and a blacklist approach often misses less common but equally dangerous payloads.

### Gotcha

Do not rely solely on client-side sanitization. Attackers can bypass JavaScript and other client-side measures by interacting with your server through other means, such as curl or Postman. Always sanitize on the server side.

Sanitizing user input is a fundamental security practice. Incorporating it into your development process protects both your users and your systems from a variety of attacks. Remember, security is not a one-time setup but a continuous effort.
