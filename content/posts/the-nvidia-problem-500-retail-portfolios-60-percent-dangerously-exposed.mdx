If you own the S&P 500 ETF, a Nasdaq ETF, and a few individual tech stocks, congratulations: **you're 60% exposed to one single crash.**

We analyzed 500 retail portfolios using our [Portfolio Risk Calculator](/tools/risk-calculator). The results are alarming.

## The Data: 60% Are Tech-Heavy

**Key Findings:**
- **60% of portfolios** have a Technology sector exposure above 40%
- **Average Beta: 1.4** (meaning a 10% market drop = 14% portfolio loss)
- **Most "diversified" portfolios** are actually concentrated in one sector

Here's why this matters:

### The "Nvidia Problem"

You think you're diversified because you own:
- 30% in S&P 500 ETF
- 30% in Nasdaq ETF  
- 20% in individual tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia)
- 20% in "other sectors"

**Reality:** The S&P 500 is **30% Technology**. The Nasdaq is **50% Technology**. Your individual picks are **100% Technology**.

**Result:** You're **60%+ exposed to Technology**. One sector crash = portfolio crash.

## Why This Happens

### 1. ETF Illusion

Most investors think "I own the S&P 500, so I'm diversified." But the S&P 500 is heavily weighted toward Tech:

- **Top 10 holdings** = 30% of the index
- **8 of those 10** are Technology companies
- **Apple alone** = 7% of the S&P 500

When you add a Nasdaq ETF (which is 50% Tech), you're doubling down on the same sector.

### 2. Growth Bias

Tech stocks have outperformed for a decade. Your portfolio naturally drifts toward winners:

- **2014-2024:** Tech sector returned 18% annually
- **S&P 500:** 12% annually
- **Result:** Your tech holdings grew faster, increasing concentration

### 3. The "Diversification Trap"

Owning 10 different stocks feels diversified. But if 8 of them are Tech, you're not diversified—you're concentrated.

## The Math: What Happens in a Tech Crash?

Let's say you have a **£100,000 portfolio** with 60% Tech exposure:

**Scenario: Tech Sector Drops 30% (like in 2022)**

- **Tech portion (60%):** £60,000 → £42,000 (-£18,000)
- **Other sectors (40%):** £40,000 → £38,000 (-£2,000)
- **Total portfolio:** £100,000 → £80,000

**You lost £20,000** (20% of your portfolio) because of sector concentration.

If you had true diversification (no sector > 30%), the same crash would cost you **£12,000** (12% loss).

**The difference: £8,000** lost to sector drift.

## The Solution: Check Your Sector Exposure

### Step 1: Calculate Your Beta

Use our free [Portfolio Risk Calculator](/tools/risk-calculator) to see your portfolio's Beta score.

**What to look for:**
- **Beta < 1.0:** Defensive (good for retirement)
- **Beta 1.0-1.2:** Balanced
- **Beta > 1.2:** High risk (Tech-heavy)

### Step 2: Check Your Sector Breakdown

If you're a Pocket Portfolio user, check your **Sector Breakdown Pie Chart** in the dashboard.

**Red flags:**
- Any single sector > 40% of your portfolio
- Technology > 30% (unless you're intentionally tech-focused)
- No exposure to defensive sectors (Utilities, Consumer Staples)

### Step 3: Rebalance (If Needed)

If you're over-concentrated:

1. **Reduce Tech exposure** to < 30%
2. **Add defensive sectors:** Utilities, Consumer Staples, Healthcare
3. **Consider international diversification:** UK, European, Emerging Markets

## Real-World Example: The "Diversified" Portfolio

**Portfolio A (What you think you own):**
- 30% S&P 500 ETF
- 30% Nasdaq ETF
- 20% Individual Tech Stocks
- 20% Other

**Portfolio B (What you actually own):**
- 60% Technology
- 20% Financials
- 10% Healthcare
- 10% Other

**Portfolio A feels diversified. Portfolio B is concentrated.**

This is **Sector Drift** in action. Learn more about it in our [Sector Drift guide](/learn/sector-drift).

## The Sovereign Approach

At **Pocket Portfolio**, we believe in **knowing the truth about your money**.

Most portfolio trackers show you:
- ✅ Your total value
- ✅ Your gains/losses
- ❌ **NOT your sector exposure**
- ❌ **NOT your Beta risk**

We show you **everything**—including the risks you didn't know you were taking.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Owning the S&P 500 ≠ Diversification** if you also own Tech ETFs and Tech stocks
2. **60% of retail portfolios** are dangerously Tech-heavy
3. **Sector Drift** happens naturally as winners grow faster
4. **Check your Beta** regularly—it changes as your portfolio grows
5. **Rebalance** if any single sector exceeds 30-40% of your portfolio

## The Bottom Line

If you're asking "Am I diversified?" and you own:
- S&P 500 ETF
- Nasdaq ETF  
- Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia stock

**The answer is probably "No."**

Check your sector exposure. Calculate your Beta. Know your risk.

**Because the market doesn't care if you thought you were diversified.**
