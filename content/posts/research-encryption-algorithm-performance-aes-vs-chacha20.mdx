## Abstract

In the ongoing quest for digital security, encryption algorithms play a pivotal role in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality. This research delves into the performance comparison between two widely recognized encryption algorithms: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and ChaCha20. By analyzing a variety of benchmarks including computational efficiency, energy consumption, and adaptability across different hardware platforms, this report uncovers the inherent architectural trade-offs between the two algorithms. The analysis leverages a hybrid AES-ChaCha20 architecture to explore the potential for optimized encryption strategies that balance speed and security. Our findings indicate significant performance variations contingent upon the operational context, with ChaCha20 showing superior performance in software implementations and AES excelling in hardware-accelerated environments. This research underscores the necessity of a strategic approach to encryption, tailored to specific application needs and hardware capabilities.

## Methodology

The comparative analysis of AES and ChaCha20 was conducted through a multi-faceted approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data. The research utilized a range of benchmarks focusing on encryption and decryption speed, energy consumption, and compatibility across different devices and platforms. Primary data sources included:

- **Official Documentation and API References**: For understanding the technical specifications and implementation details of both algorithms.
- **Technical Whitepapers and Research Papers**: For comprehensive insights into the algorithms’ design principles and performance analyses conducted by academia and industry.
- **Engineering Blogs and Case Studies**: For real-world applications and performance reports from companies implementing these encryption standards.

A key component of our empirical research was the analysis presented in the video "Energy and Time-Optimized Encryption using a Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture" by EnergyInformatics.Academy, which provided a foundational understanding of how combining the strengths of both algorithms could lead to enhanced performance outcomes.

## Key Findings

### Benchmarks and Performance Data

- **Computational Efficiency**: ChaCha20 consistently outperformed AES in software-based implementations, especially on devices lacking specialized hardware acceleration for AES. This advantage is attributed to ChaCha20's simpler, arithmetic-based operations which are highly optimized for general-purpose CPUs.
  
- **Energy Consumption**: The hybrid AES-ChaCha20 architecture demonstrated a notable reduction in energy consumption compared to the exclusive use of AES, particularly in mobile devices and IoT applications where power efficiency is paramount.

- **Adaptability Across Platforms**: AES benefits significantly from hardware acceleration available in many modern processors, offering superior performance on such hardware. Conversely, ChaCha20's performance remains robust across a wide range of devices, making it a versatile choice for environments lacking AES acceleration.

### Architectural Trade-offs

- **Security vs. Speed**: AES is theoretically more secure due to its longer key sizes and more complex round operations. However, ChaCha20 offers competitive security with faster performance in software-only contexts.
  
- **Hardware Dependency**: AES's performance is highly contingent upon hardware support. Without acceleration, its performance can lag behind ChaCha20, highlighting a key architectural trade-off between the two algorithms.
