## Abstract

This research report delves into the performance comparison between two widely used encryption algorithms: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and ChaCha20. Given the critical role of encryption in securing data across various platforms, understanding the performance intricacies of these algorithms is paramount for developers and cybersecurity professionals. Through a series of benchmarks and analysis, this report illuminates the computational efficiency, energy consumption, and security robustness of AES and ChaCha20. A significant portion of the study focuses on the hybrid AES-ChaCha20 architecture, referencing the "Energy and Time-Optimized Encryption using a Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture" video by EnergyInformatics.Academy, to examine how combining these algorithms can potentially offer optimized encryption solutions. The findings aim to guide the selection of encryption algorithms in application development, balancing between performance and security requirements.

## Methodology

The research utilized a multi-faceted approach to evaluate the performance of AES and ChaCha20. Quantitative data were collected from several benchmarks focusing on encryption and decryption speeds, energy consumption, and throughput across different platforms, including desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems. Sources of data included peer-reviewed journals, official documentation, and whitepapers from reputable tech organizations. The analysis also incorporated a review of the hybrid AES-ChaCha20 architecture, drawing insights from the discussed video and related scholarly articles. This comprehensive methodology ensured a balanced comparison, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm under various conditions.

## Key Findings

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Encryption and Decryption Speed**: AES showed superior performance on hardware with AES-NI support, significantly reducing the encryption and decryption time. ChaCha20, on the other hand, outperformed AES on platforms without AES-NI, offering consistent speed across various hardware configurations.
- **Energy Consumption**: ChaCha20 demonstrated lower energy consumption during encryption and decryption processes on mobile and embedded devices, making it a more efficient choice for battery-powered applications.
- **Throughput**: In scenarios without hardware acceleration, ChaCha20 consistently delivered higher throughput compared to AES, making it suitable for high-speed network communications.

### Architectural Trade-offs

- **Hardware Support and Scalability**: AES benefits significantly from hardware acceleration (AES-NI), which is widely available in modern processors. However, its performance can degrade on older devices or those without this feature. ChaCha20's performance remains stable across different hardware, offering a scalable solution without the need for specific hardware features.
- **Security**: Both algorithms provide strong security guarantees, with AES having a longer track record in various security applications. ChaCha20 has gained popularity for its resistance to certain types of attacks that target AES.

### Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture

The analysis of the hybrid architecture suggests an optimized approach for encryption tasks, leveraging the strengths of both AES and ChaCha20. This method could potentially offer a balance between speed and energy efficiency, adapting to the hardware capabilities of the target environment.
