## Abstract

In the realm of data security, encryption algorithms play a pivotal role in ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of information. Among the plethora of encryption standards available, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and ChaCha20 stand out due to their widespread adoption and distinctive architectural principles. This research delves into a comprehensive comparison between AES and ChaCha20, focusing on performance metrics, architectural trade-offs, and security implications. Through quantitative analysis and benchmarks, we reveal that while AES benefits from hardware acceleration in many modern processors, leading to superior performance in specific scenarios, ChaCha20 offers competitive speed and efficiency on platforms lacking AES-NI support. Furthermore, the exploration of a hybrid AES-ChaCha20 architecture highlights potential avenues for optimizing encryption tasks in terms of energy consumption and computational time.

## Methodology

To conduct this comparative analysis, a variety of benchmarks and testing environments were utilized. Performance metrics were gathered from both software and hardware implementations, including encryption/decryption speeds, CPU utilization, and energy efficiency. Data sources comprised official documentation, peer-reviewed technical papers, and real-world application case studies. Additionally, the research incorporated insights from the video "Energy and Time-Optimized Encryption using a Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture" by EnergyInformatics.Academy, which provided valuable context on the practical implications of each algorithm's performance characteristics.

## Key Findings

### Performance Benchmarks

Benchmarks indicate that AES, especially when leveraging AES-NI (hardware acceleration available in modern Intel and AMD processors), significantly outperforms ChaCha20 in environments where such hardware support is present. Conversely, ChaCha20 shines in software-only contexts, showing remarkable efficiency and speed on platforms without AES-NI, such as older CPUs and many mobile devices.

- **AES Performance**: With AES-NI, encryption tasks can see a performance increase of up to 10x compared to software-only implementations.
- **ChaCha20 Performance**: Demonstrates uniform high performance across hardware, with particularly notable advantages in mobile or embedded systems lacking AES-NI.

### Architectural Trade-offs

- **AES**: Benefits greatly from hardware support but exhibits performance inconsistencies in its absence. Its block cipher nature requires careful padding and mode of operation considerations to secure data effectively.
- **ChaCha20**: As a stream cipher, it avoids some of the architectural complexities of block ciphers, offering simplicity and flexibility, particularly in scenarios with dynamic data sizes.

### Security Implications

Both algorithms are considered secure, but their different structures offer unique security considerations. ChaCha20's resistance to timing attacks is noteworthy, especially in software implementations where such vulnerabilities are more prevalent.
