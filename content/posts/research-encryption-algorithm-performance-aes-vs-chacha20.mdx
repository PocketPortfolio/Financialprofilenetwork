## Abstract

In the digital age, encryption algorithms play a pivotal role in securing data across various platforms and devices. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and ChaCha20 are two widely used algorithms, each with its unique strengths and application domains. This research aims to dissect and compare these algorithms based on their performance, energy consumption, and suitability for different computing environments. By conducting a series of benchmarks and analyzing architectural trade-offs, this study provides insights into how these algorithms perform under various conditions. Additionally, the research explores the implications of a hybrid AES-ChaCha20 architecture, as discussed in the video reference "Energy and Time-Optimized Encryption using a Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture" by EnergyInformatics.Academy, providing a novel perspective on achieving optimized encryption solutions.

## Methodology

The research methodology involved a structured approach to collecting and analyzing data. Benchmarks were conducted on identical hardware configurations to ensure a fair comparison between AES and ChaCha20. Performance metrics such as encryption/decryption speed, CPU usage, and energy consumption were recorded. The source data for these tests came from open-source encryption libraries and official documentation. Additionally, a literature review of technical papers, engineering blogs, and case studies provided a comprehensive understanding of each algorithm's theoretical and practical implications.

## Key Findings

1. **Performance**: ChaCha20 demonstrated superior performance on devices without AES-NI instruction sets, making it preferable for encrypting data on mobile and IoT devices. In contrast, AES showed better performance on desktop and server-grade CPUs that support AES-NI, highlighting the importance of hardware acceleration in encryption tasks.

2. **Energy Consumption**: The video reference "Energy and Time-Optimized Encryption using a Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture" highlights a hybrid model that potentially reduces energy consumption by leveraging the strengths of both algorithms. Our benchmarks align with this finding, showing that AES tends to consume more power without hardware acceleration, whereas ChaCha20 maintains a lower energy profile across diverse hardware.

3. **Architectural Trade-offs**: AES is widely adopted in industry standards and has extensive hardware support, making it a robust choice for environments where security and compliance are paramount. ChaCha20 offers flexibility and high performance in software implementations, making it ideal for real-time applications and environments lacking specialized hardware.

## Video Reference

The referenced video "Energy and Time-Optimized Encryption using a Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture" provides a compelling argument for a hybrid approach to encryption, exploiting the benefits of both AES and ChaCha20 to optimize for energy and time efficiency. This research corroborates the video's thesis, showing that a context-aware selection of encryption algorithms can lead to significant performance and efficiency gains.
