## Abstract

In the digital age, encryption plays a pivotal role in securing data transmission across networks. Among the plethora of encryption algorithms, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and ChaCha20 stand out for their widespread adoption and unique performance characteristics. This research delves into a comparative analysis of AES and ChaCha20, focusing on their performance across various metrics such as computational overhead, throughput, and energy consumption. Leveraging benchmarks and architectural insights, the study reveals how each algorithm's design influences its suitability for different applications. The findings underscore the trade-offs between computational efficiency and security, offering guidance for selecting the appropriate encryption standard depending on the use case.

## Methodology

The research employed a multipronged approach, integrating quantitative data from benchmark tests, official documentation, and third-party analyses. Benchmarks focused on encryption and decryption speeds, CPU usage, and energy consumption under varying workloads. Data was collected from both hardware-accelerated and software-only implementations of AES and ChaCha20. This holistic methodology ensures a comprehensive understanding of each algorithm's performance landscape.

## Key Findings

1. **Performance Across Platforms**: AES shows superior performance on hardware with AES-NI support, a set of instructions for hardware acceleration of AES operations. Conversely, ChaCha20 outperforms AES in environments lacking AES-NI, due to its design favoring software implementations.

2. **Energy Efficiency**: ChaCha20 demonstrates higher energy efficiency in mobile and low-power devices, a finding supported by the "Energy and Time-Optimized Encryption using a Hybrid AES-ChaCha20 Architecture" video by EnergyInformatics.Academy. The video highlights how a hybrid approach can leverage the strengths of both algorithms to optimize for energy consumption and speed.

3. **Throughput and Latency**: Benchmarks indicate that ChaCha20 generally offers better throughput and lower latency on devices without AES-NI, making it well-suited for real-time applications such as VPNs and secure messaging.

4. **Security Considerations**: Both AES and ChaCha20 provide robust security, but their susceptibility to side-channel attacks varies depending on the implementation context. AES is more vulnerable in software-only implementations, whereas ChaCha20 maintains consistent resistance across platforms.

## Video Reference
