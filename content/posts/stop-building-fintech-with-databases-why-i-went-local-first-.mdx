## Stop building fintech with databases. Why I went local-first for Pocket Portfolio.

For the last decade, building a fintech app meant one architecture: a centralized PostgreSQL database, a backend in Node or Python, and an API that hoards user data.

As an engineer, I always found this disturbing. Why does a portfolio tracker need my trade history stored on AWS us-east-1? It does not. It stores it because the data is the product, not the software.

I wanted to build a tool for modern investors — those of us using Trade Republic, Trading 212, or Robinhood — who want insights without surveillance.

So I set a hard constraint:

**Zero user data leaves the client.**

That constraint became the foundation of Pocket Portfolio — a privacy-absolute, local-first financial application.

## The Zero-Server Stack

We stripped everything back.

There is no backend database.  
No user accounts.  
No cloud sync.

- **The Core:** Next.js (static export). The entire app is JavaScript shipped to the browser.  
- **The Database:** Browser storage (localStorage and IndexedDB). Your financial data lives on your device, not ours.  
- **The Parser:** Web Workers processing CSV files entirely client-side.  

No servers storing user data.  
No silent replication.  
No surveillance by default.

## The Hardest Part: Client-Side Parsing

The hardest technical problem was not charts or performance.

It was standardizing messy, inconsistent CSV exports from more than 15 brokers — without sending a single byte to a server.

Each broker formats exports differently. Headers change. Dates vary by locale. Fees are embedded or omitted. Some files are technically valid CSVs but semantically broken.

So we built a robust, open-source parsing engine that runs entirely in the browser.

The flow looks like this:

1. User drops a CSV file (for example, a 5MB Trade Republic export).  
2. The main thread hands the file to a Web Worker to avoid UI freezes.  
3. The worker identifies the broker schema and normalizes each row into a standard JSON format.  
4. Clean data is returned to the main thread and hydrated into application state.  

All of this happens locally.  
No uploads.  
No APIs.

## The Market Has Spoken

I was not sure if other developers cared about this level of privacy. I was wrong.

Within the first seven days of soft-launching the parser engine on npm, it crossed **5,800+ weekly downloads**.

Developers are already integrating the local parser into their own pipelines.

The takeaway is simple:

You do not need to hoard user data to build valuable software.

## Key Takeaways

Unlike cloud apps, Pocket Portfolio uses **Sovereign Sync** to turn your Google Drive into a database. This approach ensures:

- **Data Ownership**: Your financial data lives in your Google Drive, not a vendor's database
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Export anytime, use any tool
- **Privacy by Default**: Your data never leaves your control
- **Local-First Resilience**: Works offline, syncs when online

## Verdict

The fintech industry has normalized data hoarding. But you do not need a centralized database to build powerful financial software.

Pocket Portfolio proves that local-first architecture is not just viable — it is superior for user privacy and data sovereignty.
