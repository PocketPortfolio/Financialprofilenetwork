## Abstract

This research report provides a detailed comparative analysis of the throughput capabilities of three major message queue systems: Kafka, RabbitMQ, and NATS. Through extensive benchmarking and analysis, we aim to identify the key differences in their architectural frameworks, throughput performance, and suitability for various use cases in high-frequency trading environments. By rigorously examining each system's performance under different workloads, this report seeks to offer actionable insights for selecting the most appropriate message queue solution, considering factors such as message size, processing speed, and system scalability.

## Methodology

The research methodology involved both qualitative and quantitative analysis, including a review of official documentation, whitepapers, and engineering blogs. Benchmark tests were conducted under controlled environments to measure message throughput, latency, and system scalability under varying loads. The benchmarks focused on key performance metrics such as messages per second (MPS), average latency, and peak performance under stress tests.

## Key Findings

- **Kafka** demonstrated superior throughput for high-volume, high-velocity data streams, benefiting from its distributed system design, which efficiently handles large-scale message processing.
- **RabbitMQ** showed strengths in scenarios requiring complex routing, message acknowledgments, and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, albeit with lower throughput compared to Kafka.
- **NATS** emerged as a lightweight and high-performance option for scenarios where latency is critical, offering impressive throughput for small to medium-sized messages.

The benchmarks revealed that while Kafka is highly suitable for durable message storage and replay capabilities, RabbitMQ offers more flexibility in message delivery modes. NATS stands out for its simplicity and performance in scenarios where minimal latency is essential.

A video titled "Kafka vs RabbitMQ Differences | Kafka Interview Questions" by GKTechplex offers additional insights into the fundamental differences between Kafka and RabbitMQ, emphasizing Kafka's scalability and RabbitMQ's routing capabilities.

## Future Trends

The message queue landscape is rapidly evolving with the increasing demand for real-time data processing and IoT applications. Future trends indicate a shift towards more distributed, scalable, and cloud-native solutions that can seamlessly integrate with microservices architectures. Technologies enabling faster data serialization and deserialization, enhanced security protocols, and automated scalability are likely to dominate future developments in message queuing systems.

## Verdict

Choosing the right message queue system depends on specific requirements related to throughput, data volume, message size, and system scalability. Kafka is best suited for applications requiring high throughput and durable message storage. RabbitMQ is ideal for complex routing and message delivery guarantees, while NATS offers the best performance for scenarios needing minimal latency and overhead.
