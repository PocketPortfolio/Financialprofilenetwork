Many fintech products lock data in their own APIs and dashboards. **Universal Import is a step toward user-owned data:** the user exports, holds, and imports; the app is a tool that runs on their data.

## From SaaS rent-seeking to user-owned systems

Subscription value can sit in analysis, UX, and sync—not in exclusive access to the user's own history. The direction is user-owned data and tooling that interprets it, rather than SaaS that holds it.

## LLMs as interpreters, not oracles

LLMs here don't "decide" what the user's trades are. They suggest a mapping; the user can confirm or correct. The system then runs a deterministic parse. That keeps the model in a **supporting role** (interpretation of messy headers) and keeps control and auditability with the user and the code.

## Pocket Portfolio's long-term vision

- **Evidence-first investing:** Decisions based on the user's own data, not black-box feeds.
- **Universal data:** "Any broker, bank, or spreadsheet" via one import path.
- **Sovereignty:** Local-first import, optional Drive sync, no server-side trade storage for import.
- **Longevity:** CSV and open formats reduce dependency on vendor APIs and keep the product useful for years.

Universal LLM Import (CSV) is the technical expression of that: one pipeline, optional LLM assist, user-confirmed mapping, deterministic parse, and data that stays in the user's hands.

## Industry trends and the long tail

Regulation has pushed some banks and brokers to expose APIs, but coverage is uneven and many smaller brokers still offer only CSV or Excel export. "Export your data" is a standard ask; the format is usually CSV. Products that can interpret any trade-like CSV without a dedicated parser per broker are well positioned: they support the long tail without N integration teams, and they align with sovereignty and longevity. The trend toward local-first and "data you own" reinforces the value of designs like Universal Import—where the app is a tool over the user's data, not a silo that holds it.

**Recap: six design decisions.** (1) Mapping not free-form parse. (2) Heuristic first, LLM optional. (3) Headers plus three rows. (4) Confidence 0.9. (5) No fine-tuning. (6) Drive as dumb storage. These keep the system auditable, privacy-preserving, and maintainable.
